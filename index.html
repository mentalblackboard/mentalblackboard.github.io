  <!-- ABSTRACT -->
  <section>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p class="abstract">
      MentalBlackboard is a large-scale, open-ended benchmark designed to evaluate
      spatial visualization abilities in Vision-Language Models.
      The benchmark extends paper folding and hole punching tests with symmetry
      and rotation transformations in a physically grounded 3D environment.
      It introduces prediction, planning, and generalization tasks across
      video, image, and text modalities.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PIPELINE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Dataset Generation</h2>
    <p>
    MentalBlackboard is built with an automated, physically
    grounded pipeline based on a 3D paper-folding and hole-punching simulation
    (VPython). Folding, rotation, punching, and unfolding are executed under
    strict physical constraints to avoid deformation or self-intersection, and
    the paper is discretized into triangular regions to support diagonal and
    multi-stage folds.

  <!-- DATASET -->
<section>
  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    MentalBlackboard is an open-ended spatial visualization benchmark built
    on a physically grounded 3D simulation of paper folding and hole punching.
    The dataset supports symmetry- and rotation-based transformations and
    explicitly models the physical changes induced by rotations during
    folding and unfolding. It enables the generation of over
    12K unique folding configurations and more than
    1 million potential problem instances.
  </p>

  <p>
    The benchmark includes two core task settings—Prediction and Planning—spanning
    video, 2D image, and text-based representations, along with a generalization
    task that evaluates spatial property transfer across analogous
    folding scenarios. MentalBlackboard adopts an open-ended evaluation framework
    to enable fine-grained analysis of spatial reasoning, symmetry application,
    and sequential mental transformations.

  <!-- Evaluation Setup (Summary) -->
<section id="evaluation-setup">
  <h2>Evaluation Setup</h2>

  <p>
    We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models in a
    zero-shot setting across video-, image-, and text-based
    prediction tasks, and 2D image-based planning tasks. Performance is measured
    using Exact Match and a custom Partial Accuracy metric designed for open-ended
    spatial predictions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Partial Accuracy accounts for both correct hole matches and over-prediction,
    and is defined as
    <em>M / (G + max(0, P − G))</em>, where <em>G</em> is the number of
    ground-truth holes, <em>P</em> is the number of predicted holes, and
    <em>M</em> is the number of correctly matched holes. Field-wise accuracy is
    additionally reported for individual hole attributes to enable fine-grained
    analysis.

  <!-- RESULTS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Main Results</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>
      State-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with
      multi-stage symmetry transformations, particularly when
      reasoning over folded and unfolded paper structures.
    </li>
    <li>
      The best-performing models achieve at most
      25% exact match accuracy on prediction tasks, with
      substantially lower performance in image- and video-based settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Planning tasks expose severe limitations in
      reverse spatial reasoning, with no model exceeding
      10% accuracy when inferring folding sequences from final
      hole patterns.
    </li>
    <li>
      Models are consistently more accurate at predicting
      <em>shape</em> and <em>size</em> than <em>location</em> and
      <em>direction</em>, indicating difficulties in spatial localization and
      physical orientation reasoning.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tasks involving rotation significantly degrade
      performance, suggesting limited understanding of the
      physical changes induced by reorientation.
